   <h2>HOW TO RECOGNISE AN AFRICAN ELEPHANT
</h2>
African elephants are the largest land mammal and have a number of distinctive physical characteristics. Their trunks are used to pick up food, draw water, breathe and greet other elephants. Their large ears help them keep cool and communicate a range of emotions. Adult African elephants have two tusks which are used to peel bark off trees, mine for minerals and defend against predators.

Until 2021, African elephants were considered a single species, with forest elephants a subspecies. However, recent studies showed that their DNA differed significantly, and in 2021, the two were recognised as distinct species with the IUCN assessing forest elephants as Critically Endangered. Both have a lifespan of up to 70 years. Although similar, there are some key differences.
<b>African Savannah Elephants</b>
African savannah elephants are the larger of the two species and are characterised by rough, thick skin, curved tusks (the elephantâ€™s incisor teeth) and large ears, that are packed with blood vessels, allowing their ears to act like an air conditioner.
