    <h2>HOW TO RECOGNISE A TIGER
    </h2>
    <i>Tigers are the largest cat on earth. There are six surviving subspecies, the Siberian tiger, the Southern China tiger (although possibly extinct in the wild), the Indochinese tiger, the Malayan tiger, the Sumatran tiger and the Bengal tiger.

        They are agile, with flexible bodies designed for running, jumping and climbing. Heavily muscled forelimbs, retractable claws, powerful jaws, sharp teeth and acute senses make them incredible hunters.
        
        Tigers have a reddish-orange to yellow-ochre coat with a white belly and black stripes and their distinctive markings blend into the colours and shadows of their habitat, providing excellent camouflage.
        
        Although tiger size varies widely between subspecies and where they live, male tigers tend to be much larger than females</i>
        <h2>WHERE DO TIGERS LIVE?</h2>
        <b>Tigers are found in temperate forests, tropical rainforests, grasslands and coastal to mountain elevations in small areas across Asia. Due to their large space requirements, they typically avoid areas which are split into smaller, separate areas and/or are dominated by people.</b>

        <h2>TIGER BEHAVIOUR</h2>
        Tigers are generally solitary, living and hunting alone. The size of their territory varies depending on the abundance of prey. Some tiger species, such as the Siberian tiger, have extremely large territories of up to 2,000km. While female and male tigers may have overlapping territories, males do not share territory with other males.

Tigers use scent to communicate – they spray urine and rub scent on trees and bushes to inform other cats of their whereabouts and to mark their territory.

Females give birth to a litter of two or three cubs after a 90 – 110 day pregnancy. Cubs spend a lot of time playing, during which they learn how to stalk, fight and communicate. Adults may also show play behaviours with cubs. Cubs learn to hunt and kill from around six months of age but remain dependent on their mother for at least 15 months, after which time they will leave to find their own territory.
