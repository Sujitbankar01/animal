    <h2>LION BEHAVIOUR</h2>
    <p>
        Lions are the only big cats that live and hunt in family groups, or prides, with the females doing most of the hunting and the males responsible for protecting the pride’s territory.

Prides vary greatly in size, but can include up to three male lions, around a dozen female lions, and their young. Typically, the lionesses in the pride will be related to one another, with the female cubs staying with the group for life. Young males leave the pride, often in small coalitions, and live a wandering existence until they may establish a pride of their own by taking over another group headed by another male, in which case they almost always kill the prides’ cubs.

Lions communicate with other members of their pride, or assert their claim over a territory, by roaring. Both males and females can roar, and they possess large vocal chords, which allows their roar to travel for miles over the savannah.

Mating occurs throughout the year, with females giving birth to a litter of between one and four lion cubs after a 110-day pregnancy.

Lions will hunt almost any animal they can, from small rodents, up to rhino. However, the bulk of their diet comprises medium to large hooved mammals including buffalo, antelope, wildebeest, impala, warthog and zebra. Lions also scavenge, and will steal the kills of other predator species, such as spotted hyenas.
